# Softprobe Delivery Tracker — CLI Capture + Cursor Skills

Implementation rule per task:
1. implement the smallest change for the active task
2. validate only with Softprobe CLI flows (`capture` / `diff`) as the testing method
3. skip TDD and do not add or require red/green unit-test cycles for task completion
4. mark `[x]` with short commit-style note
5. continue to the next first unchecked task automatically (no stop-between-tasks), unless blocked by a required human decision

> Do not implement ahead of the first unchecked task. Execute in strict order.
